# IIS

Default Log location ```%SystemDrive%\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC[ID]```

If your server has multiple websites, you will need to know the IIS ID for the site. 
An easy way to get this in IIS is to simply click on the Sites folder in the left panel. 
The ID for each site is shown in the right panel.
